If you have a lunchbreak about 30 mins long and want to buy something fast from a supermarket you need to know where the groceries are. 
So for me it would be very helpful to sort a supermarket more like usual. It is very chaotic and goods are getting stored new every week.
Also because there are so many. The solution should be a regular order system with corridors, shelves and fans. For example noodles -> corridor 10, shelve 4, fan 3 to be more
clearer noodles -> different sorts, brands and so on. You should add products you want or not depends on the manager. The customer buys easysier, faster. Loyal buyers know where the products are every time. On the cash register there is never traffic. This system is new and better in more ways. So for particular reason I wrote some code in Python as a program to change these things and maybe someone is interested to execute it or I open my own supermarket for this idea.
